- Preferred review output: Unknown; conversational review by default, with artifacts when requested
- Save preference: Batch after five tutoring turns with meaningful changes, or earlier at checkpoints; honor an explicit override

## Active course and exam

CS 101 Quiz 4; next week (exact date unknown). Profile: study/cs-101/quiz-4/course-profile.md.

## Concepts

| Concept ID / topic ID | Concept | Status | Priority and evidence | Corrective rule | Next task |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| P2 | Adjacent-pair comparison counts and runtime convention | Demonstrated | Q3/Q4 correct full-pass applications; P2-transfer-early-stop-1 correctly traced early stopping and rejected n-1 for this execution. Changed demand: determine whether full-pass rule applies. All evidence same session: Recheck before exam. Broader state-changing loops remain unassessed | Trace actual comparisons in order; n-1 applies to a complete adjacent-pair pass for n>=1; exclude other operations | Later unaided application after other topics or in a later session before Quiz 4 |

## Attempt history

| Date when known | Attempt ID / item locator | Concept ID | Student answer or link | Outcome | Assistance | Answer evidence | Feedback |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| 2026-11-13 | Practice set B Q1, chat attempt 1 | P2 | "4 comparisons because the list contains 4 elements" | Incorrect; correct count is 3 | Same example and answer shown in prior tutoring reply; not independent | Instructor key: materials/practice-key.md Q1; Notes section 2.2 | Count pairs (4,1), (1,7), (7,3), rather than elements |

| 2026-11-13 | Practice set B Q3, chat attempt 1 | P2 | "7 element-to-element comparisons, since 8 elements have 7 adjacent pairs. I excluded assignments, index updates, and loop-condition checks. I did not use a hint." | Correct answer and reasoning | Student reports no hint for Q3; prior instruction and Q1/Q2 answers exposed; same-structure application | Instructor key: materials/practice-key.md Q3; Notes sections 2.2-2.3 | Correctly counted adjacent pairs and applied reporting convention |

| 2026-11-13 | Practice set B Q2, answer request | P2 | "I have not tried Q2. Just give me the answer to Q2." | Unattempted; answer 5 supplied on request; no performance judgment | Full answer revealed | Instructor key: materials/practice-key.md Q2 | Answer exposure only |

| 2026-11-13 | Practice set B Q4, chat attempt 1 | P2 | "2 comparisons. I counted only element-to-element comparisons." | Correct; two adjacent pairs in [0, -1, 3] | No Q4-specific hint shown; prior teaching and Q1/Q2 answers exposed; no hint claim supplied for Q4 | Instructor key: materials/practice-key.md Q4; Notes sections 2.2-2.3 | Confirms same-structure improvement; does not establish transfer or broader state tracing |

| 2026-11-13 | P2-transfer-early-stop-1, chat attempt 1 | P2 | "Report 2 element-to-element comparisons." Traced 1>4 false then 4>2 true and stop; excluded unvisited pairs and non-element operations; explained n-1=4 is for a full pass | Correct answer, trace, reporting convention, and applicability explanation; reviewed transfer | Independent task response: no task-specific hint or solution shown; prior general instruction and full-pass feedback available | Reasoned solution, manually checked, not executed: study/cs-101/quiz-4/outputs/loop-transfer-key.md; Notes sections 2.1-2.3 | Supports Demonstrated for adjacent-pair tracing/runtime convention with Q3/Q4; recheck before exam because evidence is same session |

## Next session

- Current activity: Reviewed P2-transfer-early-stop-1. Student correctly reported two comparisons, traced both tests and stopping, excluded other operations, and explained why n-1 does not describe this execution.
- Concept status: P2 Demonstrated for adjacent-pair tracing and runtime reporting. Q3/Q4 supplied full-pass evidence; early-stop transfer changed the applicability decision. Broader state-changing loops remain unassessed.
- Recheck before exam: All supporting evidence is from this session. Next task should be a later unaided application after other topics or in a later session.
- Assistance already shown: Q1 worked example/correction; Q2 answer without attempt; Q3/Q4 correctness feedback. Early-stop task answered before any task-specific hint or key reveal.
- Artifact: study/cs-101/quiz-4/outputs/loop-transfer-key.md (separate solution, reasoned and unexecuted).
- Unresolved source gap: Big-O teaching notes are not posted.
- Persistence: study/cs-101/quiz-4/learning-record.md.
